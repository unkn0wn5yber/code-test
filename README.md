# Unforkable Repl
Don't want people forking a repl of yours?  Use this template!  

To get started, go to `fun.sh` and change the `id` variable on line 3 to your repl id.  To get this, run `echo $REPL_ID` in the shell

Next, uncomment line eight by removing the `#` in front of `rm -rf /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG/*`.

After that, you'll be all ready to go and your repl will be unforkable.

Enjoy.
